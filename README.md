# Ter
Turing is a complete esoteric language based on the Brainfack, but potentially much more extensible.

# How to use?
Launch interpreter and input code. Press Enter to run interpret.

# What are the differences from BF?
Availability two (int32 and bool) registers for results some operations, 22 new commands (includes math and logic operations from other languages).

# For what?
1) "Just for lulz" (c)
2) Because this language is much easier to expand than the original BF, because the operation takes not one symbol, but three, on its basis you can create something interesting =)
